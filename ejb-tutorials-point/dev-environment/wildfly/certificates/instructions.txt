@description Documentation for the certificates folder

## Purpose

This folder is specifically for storing certificate files needed to communicate with external services over HTTPS
while building the `wildfly/dockerfile` image and running the respective container behind a proxy like ZScaler.

## Instructions for Use

If you need to add certificates to communicate with external services over HTTPS while building
the `wildfly/dockerfile`, image please follow these guidelines:

1. Place the required certificate files in this folder.
2. Use the following naming conventions for the files:
   - `certificate.crt` – Use this format for standard certificate files.
   - `certificate.der` – Use this format for binary encoded certificates.

## Note

Ensure that any certificates added are necessary and do not expose sensitive information.
This folder is excluded from version control; please ensure no sensitive data is committed.
